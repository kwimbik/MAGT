# 1) Strategy Evaluation
- Compute $\Delta$
- Compute exploitabily and nash conv
- Compute $\epsilon$ (as in $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) 


# 2) Maximin <==> Nash
Using the minimax theorem (slide #56), prove
- Nash => Maximin (slide #57)
- Maximin => Nash (slide #58) 


# 3) Self-play Methods
- Implement fictitious self-play  
- Implement ``naive`` self-play where you best-respond against the last strategy of the opponent (rather than the averaged one)
- Plot the exploitability of the averaged strategy for both implementations (see also ../libs/week3.ipynb)
