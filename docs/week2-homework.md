# 1) Best Response Value Function
- Draw best-response value function for a $(2 \times N)$ matrix game

# 2) Nash Equilibria From Support

- Given a support for both players, construct a set of linear equations and see whether there exists a Nash equilibrium for that support. Use SciPy to solve the constructed LP 
- Enumerate all possible supports and try to find a Nash Equilibrium for each support
